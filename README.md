# ISD Livescore App

## About this project

This project is being developed for the "Information Systems Development" Course at the University of Liechtenstein. The goal is to setup and develop an application that allows tournaments to track and display the results for tournament games via an easy to use web UI. To achieve true "live" scores, this project aims to use the websocket technology to push new scores directly to the subscribed users.

This project is being developed by Marc Schl√∂mmer and Felix Salcher
